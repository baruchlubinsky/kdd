<.heading>Holistic Management Consulting</.heading>
<p>
I am combining my experience working in fast-paced tech startups with my understanding of mindfulness and psychology to offer a different sort of management consulting.
These consulting offerings are centered on the use of my favorite productivity tool, <.hlink href="https://notion.so" target="_blank">Notion</.hlink>. 
What I am actually selling is a new approach to collaboration at work. 
One that prioritises transparency and accountibility at all levels.  
And creates process that serve and benefit all the people who use them. 
With the goal of building organisations where each inidividual is supported to thrive.

Notion

<p>
We live in a time when one's attention has become a commodity.
This makes your focus a valuable asset.
</p>
<p>
My experience with most popular softwre is that there is too much interface. 
From Google Docs to Jira, the proliferation of buttons and options draw my attention
away from the content that I'm working on.
</p>
<p>
The clean interface and pleasingly rendered documents are what first attracted me to <.hlink href="https://notion.so" target="_blank">Notion</.hlink>. 
As a Docs / Word alternative alone it is compelling. 
But, Notion can do so much more. 
</p>
<p>
Notion has powerful and flexible database functionality that can be leveraged for a great variety of
productivity and knowledge management applications. 
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, combining you organisation's processes and documentation in one platform has multiple benefits.
When done well this can enable everyone to work together with less friction and more accountibility. 
</p>
<p>
In my past jobs I have successfully onboarded diverse teams onto Notion.
From procurement to business development.
I worked with each team to develop processes and implement them in Notion as required. 
In each case the mutual benefit increases exponentially the more people are working on the one platform.

<.heading3>App Development</.heading3>
<p>
Notion is exteremely capable on its own. 
With a small amount of development we can leverage the Notion API to build custom user interfaces, and data reporting.
</p>
<p>
<.hlink href={~p"/apps"} target="_blank">This website</.hlink> show cases some examples.
</p>
<p>
Using Notion as a data store for small applications such as these has a number of advantages:
